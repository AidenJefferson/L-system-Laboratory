# L-system-Laboratory

This application was created as part of my final year project at The University of Sheffield. The application was designed to allow a user to model a parametric L-system with a focus on modelling branching structures.

# Application

The application is simple in design and use. Simply enter your desired L-system parameters in the corresponding fields to the right of the window and select the "generate" button to display the L-system in 3D.
